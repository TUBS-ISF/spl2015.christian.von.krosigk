I had some problems with the preprocessor and couldn't find a solution.

I added the commands in the MP3Gui.java, 
but couldn't get antenna preprocessor working with the selected configurations.

I also have some problems with the song infos.
The song info feature works well with older mp3-files, but won't work with new ones.
